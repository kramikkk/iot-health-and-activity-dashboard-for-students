# 📊 IoT Health & Activity Dashboard for Students

An IoT-powered web-based system that monitors **students’ vital signs and stress indicators in real time**.  
The system integrates sensors, microcontrollers, AI anomaly detection, and a dashboard interface to help students and school staff track wellness and prevent fatigue or stress-related risks.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Uses **MAX30102** heart rate sensor and **MPU6050** motion sensor connected to an **ESP32**.
- Data is transmitted to a backend server for **storage, analysis, and visualization**.
- An **Isolation Forest AI model** detects abnormal patterns related to stress or irregular activity.
- The **web-based dashboard** displays live and historical data, highlighting potential health alerts.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
To provide **real-time health and activity monitoring** for students, enabling early identification of stress, fatigue, or abnormal activity patterns for better wellness management.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Capture real-time **heart rate** and **motion/activity** data.
- Transmit and store sensor data via ESP32 to the backend.
- Apply **Isolation Forest AI** for anomaly detection.
- Display live and historical data in an interactive **dashboard**.
- Provide **alerts** for abnormal readings.
